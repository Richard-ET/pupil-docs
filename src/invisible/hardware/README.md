## Care Instructions
Pupil Invisible Glasses contain cameras and sensitive electronic components, do not rinse or wet-clean.

- Glasses lenses can be cleaned with the provided microfiber cloth.
- Scene camera and eye camera lenses can be carefully cleaned with the provided microfiber cloth if dust is visible.
- The nose pads can be cleaned with an alcohol based disinfectant applied on a damp cloth

### Disinfecting Frames
All Pupil Invisible eye tracking glasses are cleaned with disinfectant prior to shipping. You may want to disinfect the frames between uses.

The disinfectant we use is made from 22.0g Ethanol, 21.0g 2-Propanol, 8.0g 1-Propanol per 100 grams of solution. One such brand name that we use is "Vibasept". We use the wetted towlettes (wipes). Similar products should be available globally under different brand names.

Pupil Invisible is not water resistant. When cleaning, be careful around the eye cameras, world camera, and USB connection. Liquid from disinfectant might damage sensitive electronics inside the frame.  

## Changing Lenses
You can easily change the lenses of your Pupil Invisible glasses.

## Head Strap
